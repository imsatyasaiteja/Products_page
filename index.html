                        <h2>Features :</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A long-lasting battery : </li>
                            <p>Your smartphone could have a shrink-ray or turn lead into gold and it would still be
                                useless without juice. There are ways to boost the battery life of your gadget, but at
                                the end of the day a larger battery is going to last you longer.

                                The Droid Maxx is the undisputed king of batteries. It will get you close to 48 hours of
                                use.</p>
                            <li>Warp-speed processing : </li>
                            <p>Speed is still the ultimate prize in the smartphone arms race. You notice when apps lag
                                or when swiping takes an eternity.</p>
                            <li>Crystal-clear display : </li>
                            <p>Smartphones are as much about enjoying media as they are about communicating. You watch
                                movies, play games and view photos on your mobile screen and you want the crispest
                                display around.</p>
                            <li>A great camera : </li>
                            <p>You don't have to be a pro photographer to see the difference between modern phone
                                cameras and the ones on your old flip-phone. A great camera is important for more than
                                just great photos. You can use your camera for some surprising other things, like visual
                                search.</p>
                            <li>Plenty of storage space : </li>
                            <p>Most smartphones come with anywhere between 16 and 32 gigabytes of storage. Extra space
                                is a nice luxury, but these days you'll be saving most of your media in the cloud.</p>
                            <li> Wireless charging :</li>
                            <p>This is a handy feature for those of you who don't want to plug in your phone. Just set
                                it down and it's charging. And don't worry; wireless charging is perfectly safe.</p>
